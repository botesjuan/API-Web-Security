# OWASP API Security Top 10  

>[What is OWASP API Security Top 10?](https://university.apisec.ai/products/owasp-api-security-top-10-and-beyond/categories/2152491877/posts/2166165957)  

1. The Rapid Rise of APIs - business no longer needs to specialize in all aspects of creating software, instead, shared by other companies.  
2. A Major Gap in Security - techniques of the past were not effective at detecting API-related vulnerabilities.  
3. A New Leading Attack Vector - APIs often bypassed all of the security measures that had grown with businesses over the past decade.

## 2023 Risk Scores

* API1:2023 Broken Object Level Authorization - BOLA  
* API2:2023 Broken Authentication  
* API3:2023 Broken Object Property Level Authorization  
* API4:2023 Unrestricted Resource Consumption  
* API5:2023 Broken Function Level Authorization - BFLA  
* API6:2023 Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows  
* API7:2023 Server Side Request Forgery  
* API8:2023 Security Misconfiguration
* API9:2023 Improper Inventory Management  
* API10:2023 Unsafe Consumption of APIs	 

>Note, ***BOPLA*** is a combination of Excessive Data Exposure and Mass assignment.  

>***Risk*** is ***likelihood*** multiplied by ***impact***.  
>Risk score, the OWASP API Security project team has left the impact as a relative value to be determined by the business.  
>These scores that the likelihood of these scores is not taken into account (API Security Risks).  

>Values represent overall exploitability (complexity/exploitability, weakness prevalence, weakness detectability, and technical impact).

>What are the primary factors that drove the creation of the OWASP API Security Top 10?

* The rapid adoption of web APIs
* A major gap in security and the prevalence of APIs as a leading attack vector
* The ease with which an attacker can exploit a vulnerable API  

>In the absence of community data contribution, how was the 2023 OWASP API Security Top 10 list compiled?  

* Based on internal research using publicly available data such as bug bounty platforms and news  

>What is the purpose of mapping the OWASP API Security Top 10 risks to external sources like CWE and NIST?  

* To provide additional insight and depth into the identified risks  

>What is the significance of APIs in the modern business landscape?  

* APIs allow businesses to use the functionality of other applications without needing to specialize in all aspects of creating software  

>What is a leading challenge posed by APIs in terms of security?  

* Traditional network security monitoring, web application scanners, and vulnerability management programs were not designed to handle the unique challenges
