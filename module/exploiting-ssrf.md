# Exploiting Server-Side Request Forgery  

>[Exploiting SSRF](https://university.apisec.ai/products/api-penetration-testing/categories/2150259072/posts/2158923076)  

>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that takes place when an application retrieves remote resources without validating user input.  
>An attacker can supply their own input, in the form of a URL, to control the remote resources that are retrieved by the targeted server.  

## In-Band SSRF  

>The request is sent and the content of your supplied URL is displayed back to you in a response.  


## Blind SSRF  

>Blind (or Out of Band) SSRF takes place when a vulnerable server performs a request from user input but does not send a response back to the user indicating a successful attack.  
?The app does not provide an unusual response to the user, but the server does make the request to the URL specified by the attacker.  

>Public hosts to use for proof of SSRF:

* http://webhook.site
* http://pingb.in/  
* https://requestbin.com/ 
* https://canarytokens.org/  

>Example of discovered out of band SSRF in crAPI:

>Server: Burp Collaborator https://burpcollaborator.net/ response from the injected remote URL path.  

>Possible places to identify SSRF:  

* Include full URLs in the ***POST*** body or parameters
* Include `URL` paths (or partial URLs) in the POST body or parameters
* Headers that include URLs like `Referer`  
* Allows for user input that may result in a server retrieving resources

>What is the most significant driver of SSRF bounty payouts?  

* The severity of the impact  

>What is the most significant feature of In-Band SSRF?  

* The content of the URL supplied is displayed back in a response  

>What is the most significant feature of a Blind SSRF?  

* The target makes a request to the provided URL, but the app does not provide a response back.  

>Which of the following sites will not help with a blind SSRF attack?  

* ipchicken.com  

>Which of the following would be an indication that a blind SSRF was successful?  

* A record of a unique request is made by a server that you supplied a unique URL to...  

>Which of the following is not useful for testing if SSRF if present?  

* Requests that include the resources of other users  

>Which of the following would not be useful for a payload when testing for SSRF?  

* ```\' OR 1=1```
